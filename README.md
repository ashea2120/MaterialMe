This repository is for Lab 4 submission.
 
## 1.1 Android Studio and DroidCafe
 
This repo is for the following Practice Sets:
- CodeLabs Android Fundamentals 05.3: Cards and Colors
- CodeLabs Android Fundamentals 05.3: Adaptive Layouts
 
## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
- Reinforced ideas learned in lab 4 about making custom objects - made a Sports object for this app
- Learned how to load images with Glide 
- Implemented a swipe to dismiss feature using the RecycleView
- Implemented a drag and drop feature using a SimpleCallback
- Learned how to further use a click listener with the DetailView
- Learned how ot support landscape orientation with different sized screens
- A few issues with this lab:
  * When the extra layouts are added to make 3 rows appear on the tablet, the swiping feature breaks and doesn't get fixed with further lessons
  * The layouts are preserved when rotating the device - there's no activity preservation
